# Delete Button

The `Delete Button` component provides a consistent way to delete items from a cart. It handles the loading state during deletion and provides visual feedback to the user.

## Features

- Loading state indicator with spinner
- Error handling for failed deletions
- Customizable content through children
- Consistent styling with hover effects
- Icon + text combination for clear intent

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | The ID of the line item to delete |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | No | Optional content to display next to the trash icon |
| `className` | `string` | No | Additional CSS classes to apply to the container |

## Usage

```tsx copy
import DeleteButton from '@/components/DeleteButton'

export default function CartItem({ lineItem }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-between border-b py-4">
      <div>
        <h3>{lineItem.title}</h3>
        <p>${lineItem.price}</p>
      </div>
      
      <DeleteButton id={lineItem.id}>
        Remove
      </DeleteButton>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling through the Medusa UI `clx` utility and includes:

- Flex layout for alignment
- Hover state styling with color transitions
- Animated spinner during deletion
- Consistent text sizing
- Appropriate cursor indication

## States

### Default State
- Displays a trash icon
- Shows optional children content
- Subtle text color

### Hover State
- Text color becomes more prominent
- Cursor changes to pointer

### Loading State
- Trash icon is replaced with an animated spinner
- Button remains interactive but visually indicates process
- Prevents duplicate delete operations

### Error State
- Automatically reverts to default state if deletion fails
- Error handling is done internally

## Accessibility

The component includes:

- Button role for proper keyboard interaction
- Visual indication of interactivity
- Loading state feedback
- Appropriate contrast for text elements

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx copy
<DeleteButton id="line_item_123" />
```

### With Custom Text

```tsx copy
<DeleteButton id="line_item_123">
  Remove from cart
</DeleteButton>
```

### With Custom Styling

```tsx copy
<DeleteButton 
  id="line_item_123" 
  className="mt-2 border-t pt-2"
>
  Delete
</DeleteButton>
```

### Within a List

```tsx copy
{cartItems.map(item => (
  <li key={item.id} className="flex justify-between py-2">
    <span>{item.title}</span>
    <DeleteButton id={item.id}>
      Remove
    </DeleteButton>
  </li>
))}
```

## Dependencies

- @medusajs/icons (for Trash and Spinner icons)
- @medusajs/ui (for the clx utility)
- react (for hooks and component structure)
- @lib/data/cart (for the deleteLineItem function)

## Technical Details

The component:

- Uses React's useState hook to track the deletion state
- Calls the `deleteLineItem` function from the cart data library
- Handles error cases by resetting the deletion state
- Uses the clx utility from Medusa UI for class name composition
- Conditionally renders either a Spinner or Trash icon based on state
- Wraps the delete functionality in an async function
