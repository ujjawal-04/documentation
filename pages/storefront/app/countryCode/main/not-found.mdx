## Technical Implementation

### Metadata Configuration
```typescript copy
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Page Not Found",

}
```

### Layout and Design
```typescript copy
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center justify-center min-h-[calc(100vh-64px)]">
  {/* Centered content */}
</div>
```
