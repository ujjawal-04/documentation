# Orders

## Overview

The Orders page provides customers with a comprehensive view of their order history. This page is part of the customer account section and allows users to track, review, and manage their previous purchases.

## Imports

```typescript copy
import { Metadata } from "next"
import OrderOverview from "@modules/account/components/order-overview"
import { notFound } from "next/navigation"
import { listOrders } from "@lib/data/orders"
import Divider from "@modules/common/components/divider"
import TransferRequestForm from "@modules/account/components/transfer-request-form"
```

### Key Imports
- `Metadata`: Next.js type for page metadata
- `OrderOverview`: Component that displays order history
- `notFound`: Next.js utility for rendering 404 pages
- `listOrders`: Function to retrieve customer order data
- `Divider`: UI component for visual separation
- `TransferRequestForm`: Component for order transfers (currently commented out)

## Metadata Configuration

```typescript copy
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Orders",
  description: "Overview of your previous orders.",
}
```

The metadata provides:
- A clear title for the page
- A concise description of the page's purpose

## Component Structure

```typescript copy
export default async function Orders() {
  const orders = await listOrders()

  if (!orders) {
    notFound()
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full" data-testid="orders-page-wrapper">
      <div className="mb-8 flex flex-col gap-y-4">
        <h1 className="text-2xl-semi">Orders</h1>
        <p className="text-base-regular">
          View your previous orders and their status. You can also create
          returns or exchanges for your orders if needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <OrderOverview orders={orders} />
        {/* <Divider className="my-16" />
        <TransferRequestForm /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Component Characteristics
- Asynchronous server component
- Fetches order data
- Handles missing data with 404 redirect
- Renders order history interface
- Contains commented-out code for future features

## Data Fetching

The component fetches order data using the `listOrders()` function. If the data fetch fails or returns no orders, the page redirects to a 404 Not Found page.

## Layout Details
- Full-width container
- Header section with title and description
- 8px margin bottom on the header section
- Vertical flex layout with 4px gap between heading elements

## Component Breakdown

### Heading Section
- Large, semi-bold text for page title
- Regular base text for description
- Explains the purpose and additional functionality (returns/exchanges)

### OrderOverview Component
- Receives orders data as props
- Handles the display of order history
- Likely includes sorting, filtering, and detail views

### Commented Code
- Contains commented-out `Divider` and `TransferRequestForm` components
- Suggests planned additional functionality for order transfers
- Divider would provide visual separation between sections with 16px margin

## Error Handling
- Checks for missing order data
- Uses Next.js `notFound()` function to redirect to 404 page
- Ensures users don't see partially rendered or broken pages

## Design Considerations
- Clean, focused interface
- Clear instructions for users
- Consistent with the application's UI styling
- Data-testid attribute for automated testing

## Future Functionality
- The commented-out code suggests planned features:
  - Visual separation between order history and transfer requests
  - Ability to submit transfer requests for orders

## Potential Improvements
- Add loading states during data fetching
- Implement filtering options for orders
- Add pagination for users with many orders
- Include order search functionality

## Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear, descriptive headings
- Logical organization of order information
- Appropriate text contrast

## Performance Optimization
- Server component for improved initial load
- Efficient data fetching
- Potential for pagination or virtualization with large order sets
