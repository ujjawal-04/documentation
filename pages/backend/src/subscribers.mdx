# Order Placed Subscriber

The Order Placed Subscriber listens for the `order.placed` event in your Medusa application and triggers a workflow to send an order confirmation email when an order is completed.

## Overview

When a customer completes an order in a Medusa store, the core commerce modules emit an `order.placed` event. This subscriber captures that event and executes a workflow that sends an order confirmation email to the customer.

## Implementation

<CodeBlock className="language-typescript" title="src/subscribers/order-placed.ts">
{`import type {
  SubscriberArgs,
  SubscriberConfig,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow } from "../workflows/send-order-confirmation"

export default async function orderPlacedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  await sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow(container)
    .run({
      input: {
        id: data.id
      }
    })
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "order.placed",
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## How It Works

### Event Subscription

The subscriber is configured to listen for the `order.placed` event through the exported `config` object:

```typescript
export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "order.placed",
}
```

This tells Medusa to execute the default exported function whenever an order is placed.

### Handler Function

The default exported function `orderPlacedHandler` is the event handler that will be called when the `order.placed` event is emitted:

```typescript
export default async function orderPlacedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  // Handler implementation
}
```

The function receives two important parameters:
- `event.data`: Contains the data payload emitted with the event, which includes the order's ID
- `container`: The Medusa container, which provides access to services and utilities

### Workflow Execution

When the event is received, the handler executes the `sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow`:

```typescript
await sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow(container)
  .run({
    input: {
      id: data.id
    }
  })
```

The workflow is passed:
- The Medusa `container` to access services and modules
- An input object containing the order ID that was placed

## Workflow Integration

This subscriber relies on the `sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow`, which should be defined in `src/workflows/send-order-confirmation.ts`. The workflow is responsible for:

1. Retrieving the order details using the order ID
2. Formatting the data for the email template
3. Sending the email notification through a configured notification provider (like Resend)

## Configuration

### Automatic Registration

Subscribers in Medusa are automatically registered when they are placed in the `src/subscribers` directory. No additional configuration is needed to enable this subscriber.

### Dependency

Ensure that the `sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow` is properly implemented and that a notification provider is configured in your Medusa application.

## Example Usage

### Setting Up Prerequisite Components

To use this subscriber effectively, you need:

1. A notification provider (like Resend) configured in your `medusa-config.js`:

<Tabs groupId="notification-provider">
  <TabItem value="resend" label="Resend" default>

```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/notification",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "./src/modules/resend",
            id: "resend",
            options: {
              channels: ["email"],
              api_key: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY,
              from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. The `sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow` implementation:

<CodeBlock className="language-typescript" title="src/workflows/send-order-confirmation.ts">
{`import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { useQueryGraphStep } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"
import { sendNotificationStep } from "./steps/send-notification"

type WorkflowInput = {
  id: string
}

export const sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "send-order-confirmation",
  ({ id }: WorkflowInput) => {
    // Retrieve order data
    const { data: orders } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "order",
      fields: [
        "id",
        "email",
        "currency_code",
        "total",
        "items.*",
      ],
      filters: {
        id,
      },
    })
    
    // Send notification
    const notification = sendNotificationStep([{
      to: orders[0].email,
      channel: "email",
      template: "order-placed",
      data: {
        order: orders[0],
      },
    }])

    return new WorkflowResponse(notification)
  }
)`}
</CodeBlock>

## Testing

To test the subscriber:

1. Place an order in your Medusa storefront
2. Check the server logs for a message indicating the `order.placed` event was processed
3. Verify that the customer receives an order confirmation email

## Error Handling

The subscriber doesn't include explicit error handling. For production implementations, consider adding try/catch blocks:

<CodeBlock className="language-typescript" title="Enhanced Error Handling">
{`export default async function orderPlacedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  try {
    await sendOrderConfirmationWorkflow(container)
      .run({
        input: {
          id: data.id
        },
        throwOnError: false, // Don't throw errors
        logOnError: true,    // Log errors for debugging
      })
  } catch (error) {
    const logger = container.resolve("logger")
    logger.error(
      \`Failed to send order confirmation email for order \${data.id}\`,
      error
    )
  }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Related Events

Other order-related events you might want to subscribe to:

- `order.canceled` - When an order is canceled
- `order.completed` - When an order is marked as completed
- `order.shipment_created` - When a shipment is created for an order
- `order.return_requested` - When a return is requested for an order

## Best Practices

- Keep subscriber functions focused on a single responsibility
- Move complex logic to workflows or services
- Add error handling to prevent subscriber failures from affecting core operations
- Use Medusa's logger for debugging and monitoring
