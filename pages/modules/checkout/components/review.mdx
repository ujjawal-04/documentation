# Review

The Review component is a client-side component that renders the final review step of a checkout process. It displays order terms and conditions and provides a payment button when appropriate conditions are met.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| cart | CartType | Yes | The cart object containing shipping address, methods, and payment information |

## Features

- Conditionally renders based on the URL search parameter `step=review`
- Handles gift card payment edge cases
- Validates completion of previous checkout steps
- Displays terms and conditions text
- Includes a payment button for order completion

## Usage

```tsx copy
import Review from "./components/Review"
import { Cart } from "./types"

const CheckoutPage = ({ cart }: { cart: Cart }) => {
  return (
    <Review cart={cart} />
  )
}
```

## Component Logic

### Visibility Control

The component checks two main conditions to determine what content to display:

1. If the current step is "review" (controlled by URL search parameter)
2. If previous checkout steps are completed, which requires:
   - Shipping address is present
   - Shipping methods are selected
   - Payment collection exists OR cart is fully paid by gift cards

```tsx copy
const isOpen = searchParams.get("step") === "review"

const previousStepsCompleted = 
  cart.shipping_address &&
  cart.shipping_methods.length > 0 &&
  (cart.payment_collection || paidByGiftcard)
```

### Gift Card Handling

The component has special handling for carts that are fully paid by gift cards:

```tsx copy
const paidByGiftcard = 
  cart?.gift_cards && 
  cart?.gift_cards?.length > 0 && 
  cart?.total === 0
```

## Styling

The component uses the following styling approaches:

- Medusa UI components (`Heading`, `Text`)
- Conditional styling using `clx` utility
- Background colors and spacing utilities from the design system

## Dependencies

- `@medusajs/ui` - UI component library
- `next/navigation` - Next.js navigation utilities
- Custom `PaymentButton` component

## Example

```tsx copy
// Complete example showing component integration
import { Review } from "./components/Review"

const Cart = {
  shipping_address: {
    address_1: "123 Main St",
    city: "Brooklyn",
    country_code: "US"
  },
  shipping_methods: [{
    id: "sm_123",
    price: 1000
  }],
  payment_collection: {
    id: "pc_123",
    amount: 5000
  },
  gift_cards: []
}

const CheckoutPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="checkout-container">
      <Review cart={Cart} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

- Uses semantic HTML elements (`div`, `h2`)
- Implements proper heading hierarchy
- Includes data-testid for testing
- Handles disabled states with appropriate styling

## Best Practices

1. Always pass a complete cart object with required properties
2. Use within a checkout flow where previous steps are properly validated
3. Place within a client-side component due to use of `useSearchParams`
4. Ensure PaymentButton component is properly configured for your payment provider
