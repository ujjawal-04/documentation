# Address Select

The `Address Select` component creates a dropdown list for selecting shipping addresses. It uses the Headless UI Listbox component to create an accessible address selection interface with a custom design.

## Overview

The `Address Select` component allows users to select from a list of previously saved addresses. It displays address details in a dropdown format and supports keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

### addresses
- Type: `HttpTypes.StoreCustomerAddress[]`
- Required: Yes
- Description: An array of address objects containing customer address information.

### addressInput
- Type: `HttpTypes.StoreCartAddress | null`
- Required: Yes
- Description: The currently selected address in the cart, or null if no address is selected.

### onSelect
- Type: `(address: HttpTypes.StoreCartAddress | undefined, email?: string) => void`
- Required: Yes
- Description: Callback function that is called when a new address is selected.

## Address Object Structure

Each address object in the `addresses` array should contain the following properties:

```typescript copy
{
  id: string
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  company?: string
  address_1: string
  address_2?: string
  city: string
  postal_code: string
  province?: string
  country_code: string
}
```
