# Account Layout

The `AccountLayout` component serves as a wrapper for account-related pages, providing a consistent layout structure with navigation and content areas. It's designed to be responsive and works with the Medusa e-commerce framework.

## Component Overview

The AccountLayout component creates a full-width container with a two-column layout on larger screens, featuring:
- A navigation sidebar (only shown when a customer is logged in)
- A main content area for child components
- Responsive design that switches to a single column on mobile devices

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| customer | `HttpTypes.StoreCustomer \| null` | Yes | The customer object from Medusa's store API. Used to display account navigation |
| children | `React.ReactNode` | Yes | The content to be rendered in the main area of the layout |

## Usage

```tsx copy
import AccountLayout from './AccountLayout'
import { StoreCustomer } from '@medusajs/types'

const AccountPage = ({ customer }: { customer: StoreCustomer }) => {
  return (
    <AccountLayout customer={customer}>
      <div>Account content goes here</div>
    </AccountLayout>
  )
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Layout Structure

The component uses a nested structure of flex and grid containers:

1. Outer container:
   - Uses `flex-1` for flexible sizing
   - Applies padding on larger screens with `small:py-12`

2. Inner container:
   - Maximum width of `max-w-5xl`
   - Centered with `mx-auto`
   - White background
   - Flex column layout

3. Grid layout:
   - Single column by default
   - Two columns on larger screens using `small:grid-cols-[240px_1fr]`
   - Fixed 240px sidebar width
   - Flexible content area width

### Responsive Design

The layout adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile** (< small breakpoint):
  - Single column layout
  - No top/bottom padding
  - Full width content

- **Desktop** (â‰¥ small breakpoint):
  - Two column layout
  - 12 units of padding top/bottom
  - Fixed width sidebar

### Navigation

The `AccountNav` component is conditionally rendered based on the presence of a customer:
- Only shown when `customer` prop is not null
- Receives the customer object as a prop
- Contained within the left column of the grid

## Dependencies

- React
- UnderlineLink component from common modules
- AccountNav component
- Medusa types for customer data
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Testing

The component includes a data-testid attribute (`account-page`) for easy targeting in tests.

## Examples

### With Customer

```tsx copy
const LoggedInExample = () => {
  const customer = {
    id: "cust_123",
    email: "user@example.com",
    // ... other customer properties
  }
  
  return (
    <AccountLayout customer={customer}>
      <h1>Welcome back!</h1>
      <p>Your account details...</p>
    </AccountLayout>
  )
}
```

### Without Customer

```tsx copy
const LoggedOutExample = () => {
  return (
    <AccountLayout customer={null}>
      <h1>Please log in</h1>
      <p>Login form goes here...</p>
    </AccountLayout>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always provide a customer prop, even if null, to ensure proper rendering
2. Use semantic HTML within the content area
3. Ensure child components respect the layout's padding and width constraints
4. Consider the responsive nature of the layout when designing child components
